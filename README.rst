Invenio module for OAI-PMH metadata harvesting between repositories.

* Free software: GPLv2 license
* Documentation: https://invenio-oaiharvester.readthedocs.org.

*This is an experimental development preview release.*

Features
========

This module allows you to easily harvest OAI-PMH repositories, thanks to the `Sickle`_ module, and via signals
you can hook the output into your application, or simply to files.

You keep configurations of your OAI-PMH sources via SQLAlchemy models and run or schedule immediate harvesting jobs
via command-line or regularly via `Celery beat`_.

.. _Celery beat: http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/periodic-tasks.html
.. _Sickle: http://sickle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Harvesting is simple
====================

.. code-block:: shell

    inveniomanage oaiharvester get -u http://export.arxiv.org/oai2 -i oai:arXiv.org:1507.07286 > my_record.xml


This will harvest the repository for a specific record and print the records to stdout - which in this case will save it to a file called ``my_record.xml``.

If you want to have your harvested records saved in a directory automatically, its easy:

.. code-block:: shell

    inveniomanage oaiharvester get -u http://export.arxiv.org/oai2 -i oai:arXiv.org:1507.07286 -d /tmp


Note the directory ``-d`` parameter that specifies a directory to save harvested XML files.


Integration with your application
=================================

If you want to integrate ``invenio-oaiharvester`` into your application, you should hook into
the signals sent by the harvester upon completed harvesting.

See ``invenio_oaiharvester.signals:oaiharvest_finished``.

Check also the defined Celery tasks under ``invenio_oaiharvester.tasks``.


Managing OAI-PMH sources
========================

If you want to store configuration for an OAI repository, you can use the
SQLAlchemy model ``invenio_oaiharvester.models:OaiHARVEST``.

This is useful if you regularly need to query a server.

Here you can add information about the server URL, metadataPrefix to use etc.
This information is also available when scheduling and running tasks:

.. code-block:: shell

    inveniomanage oaiharvester get -n somerepo -i oai:example.org:1234

Here we are using the `-n, --name` parameter to specify which configured
OAI-PMH source to query, using the ``name`` property.


API
===

If you need to schedule or run harvests via Python, you can use our API:

.. code-block:: python

    from invenio_oaiharvester.api import get_records

    request, records = get_records(identifiers=["oai:arXiv.org:1207.7214"],
                                   url="http://export.arxiv.org/oai2")
    for record in records:
        print rec.raw
